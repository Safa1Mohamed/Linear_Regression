# Linear_Regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and one (simple regression) or more (multiple regression) independent variables. Python has different libraries that allow us to plot a data set and analyze the relation between variables. In case we observe a linear trend, we can calculate the line that better fits our data and make predictions using this line.

The dataset used in this article was obtained in Kaggle. Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learners where it can be found a wide variety of datasets. The dataset contains 1338 observations (rows) and 7 features (columns). The dataset contains 4 numerical features (age, bmi, children and expenses) and 3 nominal features (sex, smoker and region).
